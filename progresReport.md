# Progess Report
## March 21, 2024
I am beginning the process to create a machine learning algorithm to be able to read the cards from Scryfall. Before I can take on that endeavor, I must understand how machine learning can read and understand text. So I will first perform simiple text recognition tasks and then slowly work up to my end goal for this portion of the project. So far, I have a top level understanding of how text processing and now to understand what steps apply to this project what what word embedding algorithm will work for the purpose of the project. It is a lot of information so far so I will spend some time whiteboarding the project to get a full view of what this project requires.
