# Magic the Gathering Interaction Simulator

## Introduction
This project is a adventure in both machine learning and application development. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm that can query the Scryfall database, pull information from a MTG card to create triggers for gameplay interactions, and store this information in a database for the simulator to use. 

## Progess Report
### March 21, 2024
I am beginning the process to create a machine learning algorithm to be able to read the cards from Scryfall. Before I can take on that endeavor, I must understand how machine learning can read and understand text. So I will first perform simiple text recognition tasks and then slowly work up to my end goal for this portion of the project.
