# Magic the Gathering Interaction Simulator

## Introduction
This project is a adventure in both machine learning and application development. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm that can query the Scryfall database, pull information from a MTG card to create triggers for gameplay interactions, and store this information in a database for the simulator to use.
